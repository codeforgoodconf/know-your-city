# Know Your City

Know Your City is a Portland non-profit that helps develop and promote events
focused on Portland's multicultural past and present. This project is a Django
backend that powers an interactive client side map of points of interest and
walking tours.

The points on the map are managed through the Django admin by KYC volunteers.

# Technology

The administrative side is a basic Django app backed by PostgreSQL and likely PostGIS.

The front-end will likely be done with React.

The easiest front-end map to use is likely Google Maps.

# Design

Design mostly took place at [Code for Good 2017](http://codeforgood.io/). There we developed a board of [job stories](https://trello.com/b/MxJ36Xzf/kyc-job-stories) and
some wireframe [mockups](../design-docs/kyc.pdf) of the user UI.
